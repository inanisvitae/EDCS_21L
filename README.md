# EDCS_21L
Distributed System implementing chord protocol

#### Description
The whole system acts like a doubly linked list. Head is the string 'HEAD', tail is the string 'TAIL'. When a node joins the network, it notifies its predecessor and successor of joining.

#### Run
Make sure that port 3000 and 50051 are both open and firewall doesn't block these ports.<br />
Install yarn or npm.<br />
yarn<br />
yarn build<br />
yarn start<br />

Then go to http://localhost:3000
